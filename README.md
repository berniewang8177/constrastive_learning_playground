# constrastive_learning_playground
Use to demonstrate effectiveness of contrastive learing for pushing out-of-domain data from in-domain data
<br> Start with Constrastive_playground.ipynb</br>
<br> Supercond dataset is too large for manifold method to fit_transform, see the solution at the bottom of "Contrastive_playground_supercond.ipynb" t</br>
